# BBsApp
I would like to share with you my basketball app project which i made for this course.

The idea behind this app was not only to count points of each team, but also to count points for each of five players on the team. I have focused on the funcionality of app and left layout simple as it was In practice set 2 of the course.

P1, P2, P3, and so on stand for basketball players on the team... You can click on the button of 1, 2, 3 points on the selectect player who scores. The app will update the individual score of the player and also will update score of the team.

Hope you will enjoy playing with the app and maybe it will be useful for some basketabll players out there.

In future I would like to expand this app for some more statistics as counting the rebounds, assists and fouls, but for now the screen of the mobile is the limit for me. I cant manage to make it more interactive for example to "scroll" the content...
I would also like to make this app a little more interactive by adding edit view for players' names.

Thank you for your attention and lets play some hoops in free time :basketball:
